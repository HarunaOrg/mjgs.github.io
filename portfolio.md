Linkblog.io was the minimalist link curation tool, a cloud/SAAS NodeJS web application for managing your daily links. Created the infrastructure, automated server provisioning, code build and deployment, development of website and REST API, fault tolerant backend with job processing done using a scheduler, message queues and webhooks. Robust unit and integration test suites.
