Linkblog.io was the minimalist link curation tool, a cloud/SAAS NodeJS web application for managing your daily links. I created the infrastructure, the automated server provisioning system, the code build and deployment system, developed the website and REST API, and the fault tolerant backend that processed jobs using a scheduler, message queues and webhooks. There were robust unit and integration test suites for all the NodeJS code.
