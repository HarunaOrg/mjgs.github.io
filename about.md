I'm a freelance nodejs and javascript web developer, consultant and the founder of [Linkblog.io](https://linkblog.io). I write about my adventures on this blog.

I am currently available for hire for web development and / or consultancy.

Check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjgsmith) profile for more details about me.

Check my [Gig on Fiver](https://www.fiverr.com/markjgsmith/build-a-nodejs-based-website-and-or-api?arrived_from_manage_gigs=true&display_share=true) if you are a solo developer or small team looking for a consulting package.
