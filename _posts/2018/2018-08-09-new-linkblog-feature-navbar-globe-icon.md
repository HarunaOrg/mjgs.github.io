The navbar globe icon feature adds a way to link to your other online sites.  To set it up, simply update the url form field on your user profile page. Then a globe icon will render in your public linkblog's navbar that loads that url when clicked. 

It's a minimalist way to link to your other sites from your linkblog, so visitors can find your other presences online. In the screenshot below notice the globe icon in the top right just next to the search icon, and in my case it links to my homepage, which has links to all my other online sites, so visitors have a way to find among others my blog, twitter, linkedin. 

See it in action [here](https://linkblog.io/users/mark).
