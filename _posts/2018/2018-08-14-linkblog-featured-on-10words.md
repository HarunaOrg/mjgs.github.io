A good example of a linkblog is [my linkblog](https://linkblog.io/users/mark) which I also publish using the [custom domain feature](http://links.markjgsmith.com) so that it nicely fits in with my other web presences.

Some other examples of use are [posting links to blog posts]({{site.baseurl}}/2018/06/30/how-I-use-my-linkblog-posting-a-link-to-my-latest-blog-post.html) and [finding a video you watched last year]({{site.baseurl}}/2018/06/30/how-I-use-my-linkblog-searching-for-a-git-video-tutorial-i-watched-last-year.html) and the latest feature addition is the [navbar globe icon]({{site.baseurl}}/2018/08/09/new-linkblog-feature-navbar-globe-icon.html). Running a linkblog is a great way to build some context around what you are doing.
