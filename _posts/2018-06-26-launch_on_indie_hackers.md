I unnoficially launched Linkblog.io yesterday on [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/show-ih-linkblog-io-the-minimalist-link-curation-tool-ed12bec825). It's been a long road with a seemingly endless onslaught of showstoppers, but the site is up and running and it's built with a strong architecture, and running on a stable infrastructure with the possibility to scale if necessary.

There was modest amount of hits from around the globe and I even got a comment, which was at least partially positive. After a few hours I realised that I had no way to differentiate between server-side side and client-side analytics. Oh noes!

So today I setup some new views and filters using custom dimensions to show each type of data. Things are looking much better now. :)

If you're intersted in signing up, there is a promo code on the [indie hackers post](https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/show-ih-linkblog-io-the-minimalist-link-curation-tool-ed12bec825), your entire first year for the price of a few cups of coffee.
