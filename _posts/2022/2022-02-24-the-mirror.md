They: Be the mirror!

I: I won’t be the mirror!

They: we hate that you won’t do what we say, so we hate you!

[some time passes]

[everybody is a bit sad]

They: what do we do?

I: I don’t know

...

[some time passes]

...

They: Be the mirror!

I: I’m the mirror!

They: we hate the mirror, so we hate you!

[some time passes]

[everybody is a bit sad]

They: what do we do?

I: I don’t know

...

[some more time passes]

Update: This poem will be the last that I ever write so as to try to avoid even more abuse than is currentky beibg inflicted upon me. Cruelty should not be encouraged. Cruelty in the world is very real,  I am absokutely certain if that now.
