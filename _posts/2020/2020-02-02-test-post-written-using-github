Just a quick test to see if it's possible to write a blog post directly in Github.

Usually when you push to Github using git, it triggers Jekyll to rebuild the static site, but I don't know if that happens if you save the file directly to the repo without a push. Based on this [stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24098792/how-to-force-github-pages-build) looks like it probably isn't but figured I would test it out just in case.
