I’m adding a new package to my professional services called the **Custom Training Service**.

Here’s the description from the [services description page](https://blog.markjgsmith.com/2018/07/04/decription-of-my-freelance-nodejs-software-services.html):

> The custom training service covers the creation and delivery of custom training on web development and automation/workflow design and implementation. These can be made to according to customer needs and delivered either onsite or remotely via video conferencing tools. Other training topics might be possible.

I have previous experience developing custom training programs for 

- Onboarding artists at vfx companies
- Rapidly documenting feature film custom workflows using video interviews
- Training users on enterprise software products
- Training users on workflow and automation integrations

My specialities are NodeJS web development and automation/workflows, but I could also create custom training programs on other topics.

In my previous work in this area, some of the projects involved onsite visits and consulting where I analysed the existing systems and processes prior to constructing the training program. I then worked worked with designers to create training material that was specifically tailored in look and content to the client needs.

If you have a need for some custom training, then don’t hesitate to contact me [via email](mailto:markjgsmith@gmail.com).
