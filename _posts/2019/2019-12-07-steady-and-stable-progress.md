Along with the linkblog [site redesign]({{site.baseurl}}/2019/12/04/linkblog-new-look.html) and more recent [foundations building]({{site.baseurl}}/2019/12/06/building-the-foundations-for-the-future-of-linkblog.html), Iâ€™ve made steady progress with other items too, including:

{:refdef: style="list-style-type:disc; margin-bottom: 14px;"}
- Improved useability during signup, activation and onboarding
- Built foundation for upcoming SSL for Custom Domains feature
- Added tags to profile page data exports
- Optimizations for custom domains
- Database connection improvements
- Kept 3rd party modules up to date
- Faq and privacy pages updates
- Code build and deploy system overhaul
- Server provisioning system overhaul
- Refactored analytics for better anonymization
- Improved security with CSP policy
- Improved integration and unit tests
- Frontend optimizations by using compiled templates on client
- Better data validation
{: refdef}

Because of previous work done to build a staging environment and load balance the site across several nodes I've been able to make all these changes while keeping downtimes to a minimum.
