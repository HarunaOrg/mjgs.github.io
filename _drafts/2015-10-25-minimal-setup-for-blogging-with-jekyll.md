This initial post is to document how to configure the base Jekyll installation so that it's ready for blogging, with posts displaying on the main page, an archives page that lists all the posts, an about page for a personal description and social media info in the footer.

The actual Jekyll installation is covered in the [docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/). It's pretty straight forward.

For details of the modifications I made to the vanilla install have a look through the commits in the Github repo up to [this commit](https://github.com/mjgs/mjgs.github.io/commit/adf2a56ddf5427029ae0c65fe300e6e2a4366117).
